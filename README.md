# Research at Stanford University Summer 2022
This project measures the spatial correlations in atmospheric point spread functions (PSFs) simulated with psf-weather-station (written by Claire Alice Herbet). 

# Description

### psfmovie 
Animated simulation script of high-resolution point spread function. Code was adapted from GalSim repository and changed to include integrated PSF simulations at different position on the focal plane.


### runsims
PSF simulation scripts (adapt from Josh Meyers) and result-plotting scripts.


### fit2pcf
Scripts to derive correlation functions' directions (adapt from Claire) and notebooks to probe the distribution of anisotropy

### Tools used: GalSim, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, psf-weather-station, TreeCorr
